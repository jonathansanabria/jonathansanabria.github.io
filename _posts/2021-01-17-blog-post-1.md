In Copland's How we listen to music I notice the distinction between listening in 3 different ways to be very important. I had never really defined in words the ways to listen to music but having it broken down into 1. the sensuous plane, 2. the expressive plane, and 3. the sheerly musical plane, would seem to be a good way of categorizing my own manners of listening AS I'm listening to it. I have to argue against a claim made which is that the simplest way of listening is on the sensuous plane, I must argue it because it assumes someone enjoys listening to music. I have had moments where I would in that moment prefer to listen to nothing than to listen to something called music. Considering as well in page 13 where Copland mentions that we never listen on one or the other of those planes ( but instead all three), I am becoming more aware of why it is I have chosen to listen to nothing over something many times; it would seem that listening to something in those times would have influenced the production of what I was making at the times when I wished for nothing external. In my desire for nothing I was actually desiring a sense of purity in the thing I was doing which I believed would benefit from a minimal/controlled amount of external "expressive-planes".
