# Landing Page

This is to be considered my blog landing page. In this blog I will be documenting my thoughts and experiences with learning to more formally listen to music. Although I have taken basic school classes in music and have on my own time learned about a very limited amount of music theory , I believe jotting down my ideas on music will help me understand how I can improve my listening experience. In some circuitious way I would like my development into listening practices to inform the way I code, as a basic idea I think it would be interesting to make a sound visualizer using matplotlib.
