## Fugue You Frederick
The first time I heard The Musical Offering by Bach it was in front of a group people hand picked by Bach himself. We were chosen not to give any opinions directly to him but because he wanted to be sure others knew he wrote the works. We were informed that there was some fear that he may not survive such a lengthy response to King Frederick the Great and he wanted to be sure it was not suppressed by the King. The following writing details our experience of listening to The Musical Offering with a focus on Ricercar a 6. Through this semi structured listening guide, I intend to present formal elements of the work that can be appreciated by those who might have an interest in Fugues or those interested in a well-intentioned structured-disregard towards diabolical authority. In this post you will come to find Bach’s Musical offering as an elegant, well-intentioned, structured-disregard towards diabolical authority in the form of a Fugue.


Before focusing on Ricercar a 6, it is important to acknowledge The Musical Offering as a collection of keyboard compositions which are all based on the same theme. Although Bach had initially left the description of the collection as such we (his audience) asked him about the theme’s origin, he said it was given to him by King Frederick the Great. He did not wish to comment more on the King and how he asked him to improvise on the theme because Bach wanted us to experience the music without prejudice. That’s when an uproar of responses was heard in the room’s audience. Among them was Lecturer Michael Parloff who said, the King must’ve presented Bach with the task of improvising on an intro of “note values , probably designed as a diabolical plot to embarrass Bach in front of his contemporaries..”  <sup> 1 </sup> . Upon hearing the theme we all agreed that having its “descending chromatic tones occur in different rhythms (first there are ordinary halves, then dotted half, then quarters)”, was a clear sign that the King had wished to give Bach a hard time<sup> 2 <sup>. The Musical Offering takes the theme and makes “pieces of very different types: fugues, canons, sonata”<sup> 3 <sup>.


Furthermore, The Musical Offering is in itself presented in a very peculiar way. The first piece is the 3 part fugue which Bach improvised. Upon hearing the next five pieces Hans T. David immediately recognized the polyphonic build up of the canons as using “the theme as cantus firmus”<sup> 4 <sup>. Next, we were played a sonata which included a flute and was written in a modern style which may have appealed to Frederick the Great’s generation ( especially considering Frederick played the flute)<sup> 5 <sup>. The next five pieces were more canons which developed the theme canonically<sup> 4 <sup>. The last piece takes the form of a 6 part fugue Bach had promised to the king. The Musical Offering differs from the works musical would have made because contemporaries would not have been interested in polyphony and contrapuntal, they would have instead been interested in classicism <sup> 5 <sup>.


The last piece by Johannes Bach, titled Ricercar a 6 from The Musical Offering, is far from a friendly work of art. The chopped up tempos found throughout the piece are reminiscent of the vulgarity of its inspiration (King Frederick the Great). Although the counter subject introduced through most of the fugal expositions is easily respectable through its non-imitative polyphony, listeners will get a taste for Bach’s virtuosity and attitude towards the King by the way it dissipates the countersubject after “the sixth entry fills out the texture”<sup> 6 </sup><sup> 7 </sup>. As the sixth voice breaks: the wide tonal range becomes narrow, and the counter subject abruptly and cohesively becomes imitative; as if tilting a hat towards the king’s attempt to provide Bach with a rhythmically breaking theme <sup> 7 </sup><sup> 8 </sup>. The break is further amplified by a sudden slowing of the tempo until there is silence. As the sounds of the piece begin to open up, listeners will notice a sort of chaos between the voices as they seem to seek a way to be non imitative. Bach later introduces inter vocal melodies (both imitative in an ascending and descending nature, and non imitative in adding temporal rhythm) which seem extremely natural, so much so that their sounds would seem to defeat any notion of difficulty for Bach when determining how to arrange the voices <sup> 9 </sup>. As if declaring his mastery over music, Bach flutters the higher pitched voice towards the end of the piece, the melody is then followed by a harmony, and a narrower tonal range <sup> 10 </sup>. The last piece is also interesting in that “the six-voice fugue is also so devised that it can be played with two hands” on a keyboard instrument, in this way the last fugue is meant to recall the same tools Bach would have had available to him in the King’s presence <sup> 11 </sup>. 


I encourage my readers to consider for themselves how they feel about the music after hearing it. Since Bach had already sent The Musical Offering to King Frederick, I also encourage them to consider how King Frederick the Great must’ve felt when arranging to hear the piece (if he ever did). As for the group of people I sat with, after the music had finished, knowing a slight bit of the history of its conception we looked around the room contemplating what to say. I knew the work was in its own right a novel invention of Fugues because of its six voices but its balanced melody and multilayered rhythms left me without words. As if in response to a earlier statement by Michael Parloff, Nobel Prize-winning biologist Bruce Beutler claimed that “there is no way to misuse Bach’s music; it can only do good in the world, never harm” <sup> 12 </sup> we all knew he said it because the King’s efforts to misuse Bach’s talent was by our consensus thwarted. We knew we all felt the same way because when the author of “Fugue in the Sixteenth Century”, Paul Walker, claimed “Johann Sebastion Bach is widely acknowledged as the single greatest master of fugue of all time”, none of us disagreed (although we knew Bach was in the room with us, we knew Paul and Bruce would not say such a thing unless they meant it)<sup> 13 </sup>. 


Bach had later told us what the instrument he had to improvise on was. For, within the story of the works creation we found that not only did the king attempt to embarrass Bach with a difficult theme to improvise on, the King also tried to shake Bach’s improvisational skills on a brand new instrument -- the Gottfried Silbermann fortepiano--, yet his double attempt to thwart Bach’s skill was matched with Bach’s previous personal invitation by Gottfried to try the instrument <sup> 16 </sup>. Aside from the notable reverence for the artist “who was ever eager to become acquainted with everything new that was of any value”<sup> 14 </sup> I also acknowledge that Bach’s exceptional talent may be the only thing that gains his respect from King Frederich as I know I have since the theme he had presented was on its own novel in sound. Because of its novelty we do not know everything on Bach and the piece <sup> 15 </sup>, what we do know is that the circumstances which brought him to respond to the King so elegantly are also the circumstances which allowed Bach to disregard any difficulty needed to write a 6 part fugue on the highnesses music.
