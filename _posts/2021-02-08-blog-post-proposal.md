# A blog on Kyrie renditions from Guillaume de Machuat

Johannes Bach’s Ricercar a 6 from The Musical Offering is far from a friendly work of art. The chopped up tempos found throughout the piece are reminiscent of the vulgarity of its inspiration (King Frederick the Great). According to lecturer Michael Parloff, the king presented Bach with the task of improvising on an intro of “note values , probably designed as a diabolical plot to embarrass Bach in front of his contemporaries..”  <sup> 1 </sup> . But rather than an embarrassment, the work of art shows us why people like Nobel Prize-winning biologist Bruce Beutler claims that “there is no way to misuse Bach’s music; it can only do good in the world, never harm” <sup> 2 </sup>, or why Paul Walker would claim “Johann Sebastion Bach is widely acknowledged as the single greatest master of fugue of all time” <sup> 3 </sup>. Within the story of the works creation we find that not only did the king attempt to embarrass Bach with a difficult intro to improvise on, the King also tried to shake Bach’s improvisational skills on a brand new instrument -- the Gottfried Silbermann fortepiano--, yet his double attempt to thwart Bach’s skill was matched with Bach’s previous personal invitation by Gottfried to try the instrument <sup> 6 </sup>. Aside from the notable reverence for the artists “who was ever eager to become acquainted with everything new that was of any value”<sup> 4 </sup> we must also acknowledge that if we at the pitchfork put out an article which details his life and the works greatness we might help save Bach from death by the King (someone known to take pleasure in the pain of others). Because of its novelty we do not know everything on Bach and the piece <sup> 5 </sup>, yet I call on you editor, ask yourself if a composer whose mastery of music that existed in both the written and in improvisational spheres should have the chance to have his story told before the King potentially lashes out. If you think the composer should have this chance then allow me to write this piece on Bach’s life and the circumstances which brought him to respond to the King so elegantly.
